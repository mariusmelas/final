        <h2>Upper-secondary school to university</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
          The transition from upper-secondary school to university is a pretty
          big one. Having studied at IB, I was used to a pretty heavy workload
          and a fast teaching pace. However, what I did not expect was the
          amount of freedom we get in college. I did not anticipate the amount
          of self-study that we would have to do. It was great and quite
          daunting at the same time, as the saying kind of goes “With great
          [freedom] comes great responsibility”. Since homeworks do not need to
          be handed in and there are seldom any mandatory quizzes besides the
          obligatory assignments, it is challenging to keep myself in check and
          test myself every once in a while to make sure I am actually learning
          and retaining the information that is being taught.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Learning to code without prior experience</h2>
        <p>
          As someone who does not have a lot of previous experience from coding,
          besides Scratch in middle-school if that even counts, learning to code
          was both fun but also challenging. At the beginning I thought I would
          have the most trouble with learning to code with Java because HTML and
          CSS seemed pretty straight-forward but it turns out that there are a
          lot of problems that could arise when coding a web page. It requires a
          lot of trial and error and a lot of googling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Learning to code from scratch (pun not intended) requires a lot of
          motivation at the start but you can’t rely on it alone to persevere
          because motivation will come and go. When motivation is nowhere to be
          found it is helpful to build a routine to rely on. I would code or
          read about coding at least twice a week. Ideally, I wanted to do it
          everyday for a short amount of time but this proved to be hard to do
          with the other subjects and also balancing personal life.

        <p>
          With the first obligatory assignment, I learned a lot of things. First
          and foremost, it was my first time coding with a team. It was a great
          learning opportunity as I learned how to collaborate with a team and
          we also got to learn code from each other. Having a team is also great
          because they can serve as a fresh set of eyes that can look for
          mistakes in your code that you are not able to see. As someone who is
          a complete beginner in coding, it was also great to have someone on
          the team that has more experience that can break down and explain the
          code which I might be having trouble with.

        <p>
          The first oblig taught me a lot of coding outside of what was taught
          to us in the lectures. As we were given substantial freedom on how to
          design the site, I learned a lot about not just coding but also web
          designing in general. I am aware that university is not just about
          sticking to what is being taught but being new to the university
          environment I had not gotten the chance to have fun while learning and
          branching out from lecture materials. This project gave me a chance to
          do just that. It reminded me that university is not just about grades
          and numbers, it’s also about having fun learning something I am
          passionate about.
