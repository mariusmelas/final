        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
       
        <p id="ingress">
          We have been thinking about accessibility throughout the process of
          creating the websites. Making sure that the website is usable by people.
          Even with permanent or temporary disabilities, all the information on 
          the website should still be accessible and provides a good user experience 
          for everyone.
        </p>

        <h2>Different screens</h2>
        <p>
          By using relatively sized elements, the site is responsive and works well
          on different screen resolutions. When the width is below or equal to 700px, we use 
          media queries to change the layout. Font sizes and margins have been adjusted and
          the links in the main menu are made bigger for easier touch navigation such as on mobiles.
        </p>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>
          Setting up a color-palette with the use of CSS variables has made it simpler to
          stick to our selected colors and also provides a quick way of changing the color palette. 
          We made sure that the contrast between the colors
          is good. While picking the color scheme, we made sure to keep in mind the different 
          types of blind anomalies (types of color-blindness) which we tested.
        </p>
        <img src="img/color_blindness_test.jpg" alt="color blind-test">

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          We went with a simplistic approach to the
          design, letting the information on the site be the main focus, and
          avoiding unnecessary and distracting elements. Following conventions
          for how elements are placed, for example putting the main menu at the top.</p>
        
        <p>
          It's important that the whole page fits together, the pages noticeably belonging to one site. 
          The menu bar is always at the top and the color scheme is the same throughout all the pages.
        </p>
     
        <h2>Coding choices</h2>

        <h3>Readability</h3>
        <p>Elements were given descriptive names to make it easier to recognize the different parts of the page.</p>
        <p>
          We kept a simple HTML structure for easier maintainability. As well as splitting the 
          CSS up into multiple files; "style.css" is for general styles that apply for all pages, and separate 
          CSS files for more specific styles for each page.
        </p>

        <h3>Re-used code</h3>
        <p>
          The header element has been used on every page. This page, the essay
          page and the info page all have a text article. The class
          "article-style" is used for all these pages, as the base-layout for
          these articles will be the same, even if they have some unique
          elements within the &lt;article&gt;-element
        </p>

        <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
        <p>
          By using semantic tags we make sure that a screenreader can better understand the page and it is also 
          good for SEO and readability of the code. It will also help to distribute information about the page, 
          which helps the developer as well as the browser to understand what the page is about.
          For example we used &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt; for the navigation bar and 
          &lt;main&gt; for the main contents of the page. For all the pages that have a typical article 
          format, we use the &lt;article&gt;-element, so that screenreaders know that the content should make 
          sense on its own.  
        </p>

        <h2>Automated Testing</h2>

        <p>
          We have been using the automated test multiple times through the
          process, so we have not gotten many errors each time.
          Some code may initially be made as an experiment, and then be implemented. Errors can happen
          quickly and be difficult to spot after the codebase grows bigger. Using Automated tests has been 
          a good tool to identify such errors. 
        </p>
        <p>Automated tests we used was <a href="https://achecker.achecks.ca/" target="_blank">AChecker</a>,
          <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">Wave</a>,
          <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">HTML validator</a>
          and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS validator</a>. 
          Where CSS-validator and AChecker did not give us any issues. 
        </p>

        <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>

        <p>We had a blue color on the active links in the navbar to indicate which page the user is currently on, 
          which at first glance seemed fine. However, the test we did with Wave gave us an error that the contrast was too low. 
        </p>

        <h3>HTML Validator</h3>
        <p>We got some errors by the html validator that could have been difficult to spot without the automated test.
          For example a missing quote from one of the attributes in an svg image. Also, errors of tags that were not closed properly.
       </p>
