        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
       
        <p id="ingress">
          We have been thinking about accessibility throughout the process of
          creating the websites. Making sure that the website is usable for all people,
          even if you have some permanent or temporary inabillities, you should be able to 
          have access to all the information on the website and have an good experience while 
          visiting the site.
        </p>

        <h2>Different screens</h2>
        <p>
          By using relatively sized elements, the site is responsive and works well
          on different screen resolutions. When the width get below or equal to 700px, we use 
          media queries to change the layout. Font sizes and margins have been adjusted and
          the links in the main menu are made bigger so it is easier to navigate with 
          a finger.
        </p>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>
          Setting up a color-palette with the use of CSS variables has made it simpler to
          stick to our selected colors, and also provides a quickway of changing colors for
          trying out different variants. We made sure that the contrast between the colors
          is good. We also picked colors that fit the color scheme and also kept 
          in mind the different types of blind anormalies (types of color-blindness). 
          We also did a test to check if the colors were colorblind-friendly to which they are. 
        </p>
        <img src="img/color_blindness_test.jpg" alt="color blind-test">

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          We went with a simplistic approach to the
          design, letting the information on the site be the main focus, and
          avoiding unnecessary and distracting elements. Following conventions
          for how elements are placed, for example putting the main menu in the top.</p>
        
        <p>
          It's important that the whole page fits together, such that the users
          always know that they are on the same site. The menu bar always is at
          the top, and the colors are the same throughout all the pages. Margins and
          paddings are the same on all the pages.
        </p>
     
        <h2>Coding choices</h2>

        <h3>Readability</h3>
        <p>Elements were given descriptive names to make it easier to recognize the different parts of the page.</p>
        <p>
          We kept the HTML structure as simple as possible for easier maintainability. As well as, splitting the 
          css up into multiple files; "style.css" is for general styles that apply for all pages, and we have separate 
          css files for more specific parts of each page.
        </p>

        <h3>Re-use code</h3>
        <p>
          The header element has been used on every page. This page, the essay
          page and the info page all have a text article. The class
          "article-style" is used for all these pages, as the base-layout for
          these articles will be the same, even if they have some unique
          elements within the &lt;article&gt;-element
        </p>

        <h2>Semantic HMTL</h2>
        <p>
          By using semantic tags we make sure that the a screenreader can better understand the page, also 
          it is good for SEO and readability of the code. It will also help and distribute information about the page, which helps the developer aswell as the brower to understand the page is about.
           For example we have only one &lt;h1&gt; tag pr page, and use subheaders properly.
           For all the pages that have an typical article, we use the &lt;article&gt;-element, that has meaning 
           so that screenreaders know that the content should make sense of its own.  
        </p>
       <h2>Automated Testing</h2>

        <p>We have been using the automated test multiple times through the
          process, so we have not get to many errors each time.
          Some code may initially be made as an experiment, and then be implemented. Errors can happen
          quickly and be diffcult to spot after the codebase grows bigger. Using Automated tests have been 
          a good tool to identify such errors. 
        </p>
        <p>Automated tests we used was <a href="https://achecker.achecks.ca/" target="_blank">AChecker</a>,<a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">Wave</a>,<a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">HTML validator</a>
          and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS validator</a>. 
          Where CSS-validator and AChecker did not give us any issues. 
        </p>


      
       
        <h3>Wave</h3>

        <p>We had a blue color on the active links in the navbar, that seemed good by us, however the test we did with
           wave gave us an error that contrast was to low. 
        </p>

        <h3>HTML Validator</h3>
        <p>We got some errors by the html validator that could have been difficult to spot whithou the automated test.
          For example a missing quote from one one of the atributes in a svg image. Also, errors of tags that was not closed properly.
       </p>
