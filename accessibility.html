        <h1>Accessibility</h1>

        <h2>Inclusive design</h2>
        <p>
          We have been thinking about accessibility throughout the process of
          creating the websites. Starting with an simplistic approach to the
          design, letting the information on the site be the main focus, and
          avoiding unnecessary and distracting elements. Following conventions
          for how elements are placed, like putting the main menu in the top.
        </p>

        <h3>Different screens</h3>
        <p>

          By using relatived sized elements, the site is responsive and works well
          on different screen resolutions. When the width get below 700px, we use 
          media queries to change the layout. Font sizes and margins is adjusted and
          the links in the main menu, is made bigger so it is easier to navigate with 
          a finger, rather than a mouse pointer.
        </p>

        <h3>Colors</h3>
        <p>
          Setting up a color-palette with CSS variables has made it simpler to
          stick to our selected colors, and also quick to change colors for
          trying out different variants. We are making sure that the contrasts
          is good.
        </p>

        <h3>Coherent design</h3>
        <p>
          It's important that the whole page fits together, that the users
          always knows that they are on the same site. The menu bar always is on
          the top, colors are the same troughout all the pages. Margins and
          padding, is the the same on all pages.
        </p>

        <h2>Coding choices</h2>

        <h3>Readability</h3>
        <p>Naming elements with descriptive names</p>
        <p>Trying to making the html structure as simple as possible</p>

        <h3>Re-use code</h3>
        <p>
          The header element, has been used on every page. This page, the essay
          page and the info page all has a text article. The class
          "article-style" is used for all these pages, as the base-layout for
          these articles will be the same, even if they have some unique
          elements within the &lt;article&gt;-element
        </p>



       <h3>Sticky navigation bar</h3>
       <p>
        The site should be useable, even if the user <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#resize-text" target="_blank">needs to zoom.</a>
        We wanted to have the navigation sticked to the top of the window, but as this broke the usability of page while zooming, we chosed not to.

       <h2>Automated Testing</h2>

        We have been using the automated test multiple times through the
        process, so we have not get to many errors each time.
