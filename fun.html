                <span class="green-text">Charles Babbage</span>, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated 
                the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the "father of the computer", he conceptualized and 
                invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary 
                difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more 
                general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided 
                to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the 
                Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would 
                also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic 
                unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the 
                first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.

                The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other 
                web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may 
                be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the Web are 
                transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application 
                called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web 
                is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the 
                technologies of which the Web is built.            </p>
