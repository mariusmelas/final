            <h1>Digital cities and the welfare state</h1>

            <h2>Your future job may not yet exist, in what area can you imagine that a not yet existing job opportunity might appear?</h2>

            <p>
                In recent years we have seen jobs disappear and new jobs appear as a result of technological advances. Robots and 
                automated machinery are displacing jobs that were once relevant like, Travel Agents, Cashiers, Mail carriers and 
                textile workers. These jobs are estimated to be gone by 2030 <a href="#1">[1]</a>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The field of technology and innovation is the most growing field by far, especially Virtual Reality (VR). The VR market 
                size is estimated to increase by 41% by 2024 <a href="#2">[2]</a>, and we are on the brink of seeing new jobs appear. As VR 
                will develop further the equipment will be lighter, it becomes easier to use and the general user experience will be 
                better. VR technology can be used in a lot of different areas. People that for whatever reason are unable to move can 
                for example visit the doctor through VR or explore the world and be able to travel around the city from their home. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As VR develops, it creates new possibilities and builds upon existing jobs. People can take advantage of expertise that 
                does not exist in their local area, when geographical distance is no longer a hindrance. For instance surgeons can operate 
                on patients without physically being there with the use of VR and 5G <a href="#3">[3]</a>.Other instances in which VR can be 
                useful is to put out a fire, without firefighters taking any risks and saving more lives. It can also be used to help people 
                with disabilities.

            <h2>The Designer’s Context of Use for the Laptop</h2>

            <p>
                We selected laptops as the device to focus on for this task given that all members of the group own one and it is an integral 
                part of our student lives. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The context of use the designers had in mind when creating the laptop, was a more portable and travel friendly alternative to 
                the desktop computer. In order to make the laptop more portable it has been made into a single unit and can be folded in half 
                thus taking up less desk space. This also means that individuals require less peripherals as the monitor, keyboard, trackpad 
                and speakers have all been built into one device <a href="#4">[4]</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The multiple intended use for the laptop include being able to work on the go, to aid in student life, and a portable means of 
                entertainment such as for gaming and media consumption <a href="#5">[5]</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The laptop requires considerable literacy skills, it is highly dependent on being able to read and type. However, text-to-speech 
                has been developed which enables users to have the text read aloud to them and in certain cases the microphone can be used as 
                an alternative to typing. Although it is not always accurate and not all languages are supported.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unlike the desktop computer, the laptop is not fully dependent on a stable access to electricity. However, it does require to be 
                charged after some time for a few hours. Furthermore, most of the services provided on the laptop require a steady internet 
                connection which is not always available in more rural areas. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The laptop is prone to damage from less than ideal environments such as dust, humid, and extreme temperatures making outdoor use 
                challenging . The device itself was not intended to be used by younger children as it requires basic literacy skills and the 
                ability to grasp technological concepts.
