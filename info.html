          Your future job may not yet exist, in what area can you imagine that a
          not yet existing job opportunity might appear?
        </h2>
        <div class="article-intro">
          <p>
            In recent years we have seen jobs disappear and new jobs appear as a
            result of technological advances. Robots and automated machinery are
            displacing jobs that were once relevant like, Travel Agents,
            Cashiers, Mail carriers and textile workers. These jobs are
            estimated to be gone by 2030 <a href="#references" id="1-link" title="Scroll down to references">[1]</a>.

        <p>
          The field of technology and innovation is the most growing field by
          far, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality" 
          title="Visit Wikipedia page about Virtual Reality">
          Virtual Reality (VR)</a>. The VR market size is estimated to increase 
          by 41% by 2024 <a href="#references" id="2-link" 
          title="Scroll down to references">[2]</a>, and we are on the brink of 
          seeing new jobs appear. As VR will develop further the equipment will 
          be lighter, it becomes easier to use and the general user experience 
          will be better. VR technology can be used in a lot of different areas. 
          People that for whatever reason are unable to move can for example 
          visit the doctor through VR or explore the world and be able to travel 
          around the city from their home.
        </p>

        <p>
          As VR develops, it creates new possibilities and builds upon existing
          jobs. People can take advantage of expertise that does not exist in
          their local area, when geographical distance is no longer a hindrance.
          For instance surgeons can operate on patients without physically being
          there with the use of VR and 5G <a href="#references" id="3-link" 
          title="Scroll down to references">[3]</a>.Other instances in which VR 
          can be useful is to put out a fire, without firefighters taking any risks 
          and saving more lives. It can also be used to help people with disabilities.

        <h2>The Designer’s Context of Use for the Laptop</h2>
        <div class="article-intro">
          <p>
            We selected laptops as the device to focus on for this task given
            that all members of the group own one and it is an integral part of
            our student lives.
          </p>

        <p>
          The context of use the designers had in mind when creating the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop" 
          title="Visit Wikipedia page about laptop">laptop </a>,
          was a more portable and travel friendly alternative to the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer" 
          title="Visiy Wikipedia page about desktop computer">desktop
          computer</a>. In order to make the laptop more portable it has been made
          into a single unit and can be folded in half thus taking up less desk
          space. This also means that individuals require less peripherals as
          the monitor, keyboard, trackpad and speakers have all been built into
          one device <a href="#references" id="4-link" title="Scroll down to references">[4]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The multiple intended use for the laptop include being able to work on
          the go, to aid in student life, and a portable means of entertainment
          such as for gaming and media consumption
          <a href="#references" id="5-link" title="Scroll down to references">[5]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The laptop requires considerable literacy skills, it is highly
          dependent on being able to read and type. However,
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis"
            title="Visit Wikipedia page about text to speech">text-to-speech</a> has
          been developed which enables users to have the text read aloud to them
          and in certain cases the microphone can be used as an alternative to
          typing. Although it is not always accurate and not all languages are
          supported.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike the desktop computer, the laptop is not fully dependent on a
          stable access to electricity. However, it does require to be charged
          after some time for a few hours. Furthermore, most of the services
          provided on the laptop require a steady <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"
          title="Visit wikipedia page about Internet">internet </a> connection which is
          not always available in more rural areas.
        </p>

        <p>
          The laptop is prone to damage from less than ideal environments such
          as dust, humid, and extreme temperatures making outdoor use
          challenging . The device itself was not intended to be used by younger
          children as it requires basic literacy skills and the ability to grasp
          technological concepts.
